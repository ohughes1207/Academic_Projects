# 20212 FERRE Undergraduate Project

The atmospheric properties of 735 observed spectra from chemically peculiar Ap stars have been measured using theoretical grids of star spectra. Model grids have been applied to the 735 spectra using the FERRE data analysis code. This project presents the results of the fit of the observed spectra to the model grid and discusses which are the best fit. The results show that the best fit is achieved when continuum normalizing with a polynomial with an order of 4 and effective temperature, log(g) and metallicity [M/H] are varied however there is potential for a four parameter fit including the α-elements and continuum normalizing with a polynomial with an order of 3. The errors in the effective temperature, log(g), metallicity and α-elements are estimated to be ±100K, ±0.1, ±0.2 dex and ±0.2 dex respectively.
