# 20212 FERRE Undergraduate Project

The atmospheric properties of 735 observed spectra from chemically peculiar Ap stars have been measured using theoretical grids of star spectra. Model grids have been applied to the 735 spectra using the FERRE data analysis code. This project presents the results of the fit of the observed spectra to the model grid and discusses which are the best fit. The results show that the best fit is achieved when continuum normalizing with a polynomial with an order of 4 and effective temperature, log(g) and metallicity [M/H] are varied however there is potential for a four parameter fit including the α-elements and continuum normalizing with a polynomial with an order of 3. The errors in the effective temperature, log(g), metallicity and α-elements are estimated to be ±100K, ±0.1, ±0.2 dex and ±0.2 dex respectively.

## Introduction

By taking advantage of exoplanet survey from NASA’s Explorers program in 2018, an analysis of the spectra of stars can be done. The stars analysed in this project have been monitored from the TESS satellite with photometric time series observations and were selected because of suspected high frequency pulsations. The fluxes and wavelengths of 735 chemically peculiar Ap stars have been observed. The instrument used for the observations was a 1.9m telescope with low resolution grating and 2 arcseconds per 2 pixels. FERRE is a software written in FORTRAN90 that analyses data by matching models to data, the software will be used to analyse 735 spectra, this software could be a valuable tool in future endeavours. The goal of this project is to determine the atmospheric properties of peculiar, pulsating A star candidates, to do this, A software called FERRE will be used analyse the spectra of 735 stars, this software produces data by fitting the observations with the model grids provided by the ATK library. The model grid used for this analysis has an effective temperature upper limit and lower limit of 10000K and 6000K, log(g) has and upper limit of 5 and lower limit of 2 and metallicity [M/H] has an upper limit of 0.5 dex and lower limit of -2.5 dex.
