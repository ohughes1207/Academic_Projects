## Introduction

I was introduced to programming during my 1st year at UCLan where we were taught the fundamentals of Python, from printing "Hello, World" to loading data from a .txt file for data analysis. This practice was continued throughout the 2nd year and was expanded upon with creating our own modules and functions, and being introduced to the scientific libraries for Python such as Scipy, numpy and matplotlib and more. I found that I wanted to pursure a career and delve deeper into programming after finding my Python assignments and projects throughout my time at UCLan fulfilling.
