## Introduction

I was introduced to programming during my 1st year at UCLan where we were taught the fundamentals of Python, from printing "Hello, World" to loading data from .txt and .dat files for data analysis. Fundamentals were further developed throughout the 2nd year and was expanded upon with creating our own modules and functions, and being introduced to the scientific libraries for Python such as Scipy, numpy and matplotlib and more. I found that I wanted to pursure a career and delve deeper into programming after finding my Python assignments and projects throughout my time at UCLan fulfilling.

This repository contains my academic projects from UCLan.

## 2022 sMILES Masters Project

The goal of my final year project was to determine the best fitting simple stellar population (SSP) from the sMILES spectral library to the galaxy GAMA422436. This was acheived by processing both the data from the sMILES library and GAMA422436, then determining the reduced chi-squared for each SSP to then find the best fitting SSP to the galaxy.

The results of this project found that the best fitting SSP has a solar-like \[Î±/Fe\] ratio, an age of 5 Gyrs and a metallicity of +0.4 dex. However, the results also showed that overall the SSPs do not match the target galaxy.
